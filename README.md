# Protein Structure Prediction

This repo contains a [notebook](protein_structure_prediction.ipynb) showcasing three physics-inspired methods to predict the 3D structure of a family of proteins starting from a Multiple Sequence Alignment.

The Julia packages implementing the three methods were written by their authors and are [GaussDCA.jl](https://github.com/carlobaldassi/GaussDCA.jl), [PlmDCA.jl](https://github.com/pagnani/PlmDCA.jl), [ArDCA.jl](https://github.com/pagnani/ArDCA.jl).
